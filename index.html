    I know the distance between us may not always be easy. There are days when I miss you so much,
    and I really want to be next to you, sharing laughter, stories, even just being together in silence.
    But in every moment, I always remember how strong we are, how great our relationship is that can survive
    even though there is distance that separates us.

    I want to thank you, because you are always there for me, even though maybe you also feel the same
    longing. Thank you for always strengthening me when I feel down, always giving me encouragement when
    I need it, and always supporting my dreams even though we are far away. You are my source of strength, 
    even from a distance. And I'm truly grateful to be able to call you my girlfriend.

    Many say, LDR is difficult. I will not deny, there are difficult times we go through. But, every time 
    I remember you, I feel like it's all worth it. Because in the end, our love is always stronger than this
    longing. I believe, all of this will only make us closer, stronger, and more appreciative of every moment 
    we will spend together.

    I can't wait for the day when this distance is no longer an obstacle. But for now, I just want you to
    know how much I appreciate every effort, patience, and love you give. Thank you for being the best 
    girlfriend to me. Thank you for always believing that we can get through this together.

    I love you, and I will always wait for you, no matter how far apart we are now. ❤️
